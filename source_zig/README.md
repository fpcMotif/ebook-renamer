# Zig Implementation

This is a minimal Zig implementation showing the basic structure and logging approach.

## Building

```bash
cd source_zig
zig build
```

## Running

```bash
zig build run -- /path/to/ebooks
```

## Status

This is a placeholder implementation demonstrating:
- Basic Zig project structure
- Logging to stderr with timestamps
- Command-line argument handling

A full implementation would require additional modules for:
- CLI argument parsing
- File system scanning
- Filename normalization
- Duplicate detection
- Todo list generation
